## About Me

I’m a Senior Security Algorithm Engineer at Ant Group and a PhD candidate at ECNU. Before I work at Ant Group, I graduated from the University of Edinburgh in 2018, and I was fortunate to be supervised by Dr Myrto Arapinis.

I maintain an awesome list for secure computation papers (including MPC, lattice, DP, etc.) at: [https://github.com/Jamie-Cui/awesome-secure-computation](https://github.com/Jamie-Cui/awesome-secure-computation)

## Research Interests

- Secure computation primitives and protocols: OT, VOLE, PSI, etc.
- Foundations of cryptography
- Privacy-preserving machine learning
